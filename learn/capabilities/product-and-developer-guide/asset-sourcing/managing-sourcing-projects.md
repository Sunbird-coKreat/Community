### Managing Users

Every project that is launched by the sourcing organization needs users who are competent to review, approve or reject contributions received for the project.&#x20;

For example, if a sourcing organization launched a set of projects to seek content for a program. Each project will need a set of reviewers to review the contributions made, and either approve or reject them. Reviewers may not necessarily be part of the sourcing organization. The organization has the choice to involve experts to ensure quality content.&#x20;

Sourcing organization administrators can:&#x20;

a) enrol users to a project

b) assign users with appropriate roles for the sourcing projects that they manage&#x20;

#### User Roles&#x20;

The sourcing organization has two types of users:&#x20;

a) Administrator&#x20;

b) Reviewer&#x20;

#### **Administrator**&#x20;

_Role definition:_ A sourcing organization administrator manages and tracks projects, users and nominations for the entire organization.&#x20;

_Responsibilities:_&#x20;

* Manage projects&#x20;
* Manage users&#x20;
* Review nominations&#x20;
* Review contributions&#x20;
* Manage and track project and organization activities&#x20;

#### **Reviewer**&#x20;

_Role definition:_ A reviewer reviews nominations and contributions for a project. A user is a reviewer for the sourcing project to which he/she is associated. A user may be assigned as a reviewer to multiple projects.&#x20;

_Responsibilities:_&#x20;

* Review nominations&#x20;
* Review contributions&#x20;

_How is the role assigned?_&#x20;

The sourcing org administrator invites the user to be part of the organization. If the user is not already registered, the user registers and becomes part of the organization by accepting the invitation. The sourcing org admin assigns the user the reviewer role for the associated project&#x20;

Note: Users can be invited to and can be part of multiple sourcing organizations. Users can be assigned as reviewers to multiple projects.

### Managing Contributions

Sourcing org administrator has access to the contribution dashboard, at the level of the project, which provides a view of count of contributions by users and in what stage they are currently in. Administrators can also download this information in a csv format. Thereby allowing them to effectively manage the contributions.
