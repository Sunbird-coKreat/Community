d) Question Set - click [here](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-Mi9QwJlsfb7xuxTBc0J/s/Wu4HIWGkb7dD4y0Kup4W/) to know more about this asset type

e) Media Resources - This asset type comprises of lowest level of reusable assets such as images, video, audio files etc

* **Enables creation of categories to cater to domain specific solutions through configuration without any code changes.**

Unlike an **Asset**, which is a core entity of the system, a category is just a “label” tagged to an object and can be defined to inherit a specific set of properties and behaviors - which are a subset of those supported by the asset.

Hence, categories are completely driven by configuration, without any category specific logic implemented in the code.

Example from education - _**Exam Question paper, Practice Worksheet, Quiz**_ each one is a category of the asset type **Question set.**\
Analogous example from the real-world - A _**Shoe, Sandal, Flip-flops**_ each one is a category of the asset type **foot wear.**

* **Provides rich and customizable tagging frameworks to efficiently organize your assets and help users discover relevant assets.**
* **Provides tools such as editors and players to create and consume these assets.**
