# Organised Collections

### Collections

Collections are a multi-level hierarchical set of assets -content, question sets or even other collections.

The key capabilities of Collections are:

* Ability to create various categories of collections as per your solution or specific to your domain needs.
* Provides you the ability to organize your assets in a multi-level hierarchy. Each level of hierarchy can have one or more folders to group the assets.
* Ability to link one or more assets (of any type defined in the asset model) under a given folder. The type of assets that can be linked at a given level is configuration driven.
*   Ability to tag metadata at all levels to ensure efficient organization of collections and to facilitate ease of discovery:

    a) The collection (root) level

    b) Folder level and

    c) As part of asset to collection relation
*   Ability for 'Deep copy' & 'Shallow copy' of collections.

    _A “deep” copy of a collection copies the complete hierarchy and the asset links, the assets themselves are not copied_**.**

    _A “shallow” copy of a collection just copies the root and points to the same hierarchy of original collection._
* Ability to create and edit collections using the **'Collection editor'** tool.
* Ability to link DIAL codes to a collection to power phygital discovery of collections.
