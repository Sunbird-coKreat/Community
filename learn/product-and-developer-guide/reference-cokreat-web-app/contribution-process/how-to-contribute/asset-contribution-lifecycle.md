The asset contribution lifecycle varies depending on whether the user has enrolled as an individual contributor or as an contributor organization.

The initial stage of asset creation is Draft. In this stage asset creation happens.&#x20;

After the creation, when submitted for review, asset move to the Live state where the sourcing org reviewer can Publish or Reject or send back the asset for corrections.

If the asset is **sent back for corrections** asset's status will change from Live to Draft. If the sourcing org reviewer **publishes** the asset then the asset will be available for consumption. If the sourcing org reviewer **rejects** the asset, it just stays in Live state in coKreat sourcing repository.
