# Contribution Registry

Contribution registry stores the information about the individual contributors, organizations and the roles of various users in the organization. It also stores the metadata of the project scope.&#x20;

### **Contributor Organization**

When user enrolls as a **Contributor Organization**, Contribution Registry stores the User, Org and User\_Org Schemas.  User gets added as the organization admin, who has the privilege to invite other users to join this organization from contribution portal. These users can be called as Contributor Organization Users.

An Organization admin can:\
&#x20;\-  nominate their organization for contributing to a project\
&#x20;\-  invite users to contribute to their projects\
&#x20;\-  assign contributors or reviewers to their project\
&#x20;\-  review contributions done by contributors \
\
Users who accept the invite to join the organization to contribute content are given contributor roles within that organization. Admin can also grant 'Reviewer' roles to these contributors.&#x20;

### Individual Contributor

When a user enrolls as an **Individual Contributor**, only User schema is added to the Contribution Registry.&#x20;

An Individual Contributor can : \
&#x20;\- contribute the content by nominating to the respective project as an individual.\
