# Workspace

Workspace facilitates in-house creation of assets. For ex., If the organization has in-house creators and reviewers who can create and curate content without the need to crowdsource it from other individuals or organizations then workspace can be used to meet such creation needs.  The roles that are needed are:

a) content\_creator - this role has access to create content and collections.

b) content\_reviewer - this role has access to curate content and collections.

Organization, based on its creation needs, can configure what asset types are to be shown in the workspace and the editors to be used for the creation of these asset types in the workspace. For example, workspace shown in the below screen shot is configured to show and allow for creation of asset types such as:

a) **collections** like book and course

b) **content** like resource&#x20;

c) **question sets** like course assessment

### Collection

Collection is a group of content which is structured in a specific sequence. For example a course, which is a category of collection, contains learning resources and assessment(s) which are grouped as modules and organized in a specific sequence as per the target audience of the course.&#x20;

Collection editor, which powers the creation of collections, enables creators to create this structure, add relevant content and appropriate tagging as shown in the below screenshots.&#x20;

### Content

Asset type content can have different categories such as explanation content, learning resource etc. These categories and their behaviour can be created and defined at system level by the system administrator. Basis the need, different types of editors can be configured to enable the creation of content. For example, generic editor can be configured if you would want your creators to upload content or an interactive editor if you would want your creators to create content from scratch on the portal as shown in the below screen shots.&#x20;

### Question set

Depending on your use cases, asset type question set can have different categories such as assessments, worksheets, surveys etc. These categories and their behaviour can be defined by the system administrator. The creation of question sets is enabled by the question set editor.&#x20;
